# adhd prediction in youth 

This project explores whether combining demographic data with ASRS-V1.1 self-screening responses can improve the prediction of ADHD symptom clusters (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) in young adults using multi-label classification. It also evaluates the impact of demographic features and data augmentation techniques (MLSMOTE) on prediction accuracy.

Ready-made code is available in adhd_dataset.ipynb
the final report with analysis and discussion is included in the repository.
